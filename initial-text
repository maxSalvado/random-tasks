I’m Max from **\[Org/BU]**. I’m preparing a submission called **BlueOps — ML for water efficiency & leak reduction**. It uses building/IoT meter data and time-series anomaly detection to flag leaks/continuous flow, create tickets, and quantify **m³/\$** savings. The concept aligns with **SDG 6**, our **“self as we”** ethos, and has clear stakeholder value (Facilities, ESG, IT) with external appeal for clients.

Quick eligibility question: **Does the conference accept projects that are in development with an MVP ready by the event date, or only those already in pilot/production?** We can deliver a lightweight MVP in \~8–10 weeks (dashboard + live alert → ticket) and commit to KPIs (e.g., **# leaks fixed, m³ saved, payback**).

If possible, could you share guidance on evaluation emphasis (social impact, uniqueness, stakeholder fit, external appeal) and demo expectations (live vs. recorded), plus key dates and submission format?

Happy to send a 1-pager and pilot outline. Thanks for your time!

Best regards,
