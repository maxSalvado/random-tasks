Modernize the IT Service Catalog by migrating to a new Angular + Azure web app with Entra ID SSO and secure content management.


# üöÄ IT Service Catalog Migration to Modern Azure Stack

This repository contains the source code and project documentation for migrating the current IT Service Catalog to a modern, secure web application built with **Angular** and **Azure** (Functions + Cosmos DB). The goal is to enhance maintainability, implement SSO via **Microsoft Entra ID**, and provide a user-friendly CMS for internal teams.

## üìå Project Overview

**Project Title**: Migrate IT Service Catalog to Modern Azure/Angular Stack with Entra ID SSO

As an IT solutions company, we aim to migrate our existing service catalog (currently hosted on Vercel) to a new web application using Angular and Azure technologies. The new platform will:
- Provide secure access via Entra ID Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Enable content management through a role-based system
- Support internal reporting on leads and showcase actions
- Be published as a stable MVP on Azure

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- ‚úÖ Catalog content is migrated from the existing site to the new Angular app hosted on Azure
- ‚úÖ SSO authentication via Microsoft Entra ID, allowing access only to internal users
- ‚úÖ Role-based access: Only authorized groups can add/edit/delete catalog content
- ‚úÖ CMS-friendly UI for editors to manage catalog items
- ‚úÖ Reporting table for editors to log leads and showcase actions
- ‚úÖ MVP is deployed, stable, and accessible via browser

## üë§ User Stories

1. As an **IT admin**, I want to migrate the catalog to a modern platform for better usability and control.
2. As an **employee**, I want to log in securely using Entra ID SSO for a seamless experience.
3. As a **catalog editor**, I want to manage content through the new app to keep information up to date.
4. As a **sales/marketing editor**, I want to log leads and showcase actions for engagement tracking.
5. As a **stakeholder**, I want to access and use a functional MVP with documentation and a deployed instance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular (deployed via Azure Static Web Apps)
- **Backend**: Azure Functions (Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
- **Authentication**: Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)
- **Access Control**: RBAC via Entra ID or Azure Portal
- **Deployment**: Azure Cloud (Static Web Apps + Functions)

---

## üí° Recommendations

- Use **Azure Static Web Apps** for deploying the Angular frontend with Azure Functions.
- Manage user groups and roles directly in **Entra ID/Azure**, avoiding admin UI in the MVP.
- Consider adding analytics, accessibility improvements, and audit logging **after MVP** release.
